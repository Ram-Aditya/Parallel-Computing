The images are the output of 5 runs of each of the different versions of the parallelized code.

  Image Name
parallel_x :	Produced by parallelizing the inner loop alone.(x-coordinate)
parallel_y : 	Produced by parallelizing the outer loop alone.(y-coordinate).This produces erroneous output as inner loop is executed     			for every iteratation of outer loop by each thread.
parallel   :	Produced by appropriately parallelizing both loops which produces much better images.
